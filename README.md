# Raspbeat

This is a repo to hold my frankenstein Raspberry Pi/Arduino/MIDI/Pure Data monster project. Still a WIP.

So far, we have 
	- an Arduino sketch, pulling in the Enable Interrupt Library, that serves as a ADC to turn piezo signals into MIDI
	- a basic Pure Data patch that can't yet talk to the outside world
